# Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

## Overview

This document captures the key architectural decisions made for the Aegis Support platform and the rationale behind each choice.

---

## 1. Server-Side Rendering (SSR) vs Client-Side Rendering (CSR)

**Decision**: Hybrid approach using Next.js App Router with selective SSR

**Rationale**:
• **SSR for public pages**: Better SEO and initial load performance for landing and marketing pages
• **CSR for dashboard**: Real-time updates and interactive features benefit from client-side state management
• **Streaming SSR**: Utilized for data-heavy pages to improve perceived performance
• **Static Generation**: Used for knowledge base articles and documentation

**Trade-offs**:
• (+) Optimal performance for each use case
• (+) Better SEO for public content
• (-) Increased complexity in data fetching patterns
• (-) Potential hydration mismatches need careful handling

---

## 2. Database Partitioning Strategy

**Decision**: Time-based partitioning for transactions table, customer-based sharding for alerts

**Rationale**:
• **Transaction volume**: ~1M+ transactions/month requires efficient querying
• **Query patterns**: Most queries are time-bounded (last 30/60/90 days)
• **Alert distribution**: Customer-based sharding ensures even distribution
• **Maintenance**: Automated partition management with monthly rotation

**Trade-offs**:
• (+) Improved query performance for time-based queries
• (+) Easier archival of old data
• (-) Complex cross-partition queries
• (-) Additional maintenance overhead

---

## 3. Fallback and Resilience Policy

**Decision**: Circuit breaker pattern with exponential backoff and graceful degradation

**Rationale**:
• **AI service dependency**: LLM services may be unavailable or slow
• **User experience**: System should remain functional even with service failures
• **Cost control**: Prevent cascading failures and unnecessary API calls

**Implementation**:
• Circuit breaker opens after 3 consecutive failures
• Exponential backoff: 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, max 30s
• Fallback to cached responses or simplified analysis
• Queue-based retry for non-critical operations

---

## 4. Microservices vs Monolithic Architecture

**Decision**: Modular monolith with clear domain boundaries

**Rationale**:
• **Team size**: Small team benefits from simplified deployment
• **Operational overhead**: Reduced complexity compared to microservices
• **Future flexibility**: Module boundaries allow future extraction if needed
• **Performance**: Avoid network latency between services

**Trade-offs**:
• (+) Simpler deployment and debugging
• (+) Better performance (no network calls)
• (-) Scaling limitations (must scale entire application)
• (-) Technology lock-in for all modules

---

## 5. Real-time Communication Protocol

**Decision**: Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time updates, WebSockets reserved for future bidirectional needs

**Rationale**:
• **Simplicity**: SSE is simpler to implement and maintain
• **Use case fit**: Primarily server-to-client updates (fraud alerts, progress)
• **HTTP/2 support**: Multiplexing reduces connection overhead
• **Fallback**: Automatic reconnection and event ID support

**Trade-offs**:
• (+) Works through proxies and firewalls
• (+) Built-in reconnection
• (-) Unidirectional only
• (-) Limited browser support for older versions

---

## 6. Caching Strategy

**Decision**: Multi-layer caching with Redis as primary cache and React Query for client-side

**Rationale**:
• **Performance**: Reduce database load and API latency
• **User experience**: Instant UI updates with optimistic mutations
• **Cost**: Reduce LLM API calls through intelligent caching

**Implementation**:
• Redis: 5-minute TTL for frequently changing data
• React Query: 30-second stale time for dashboard data
• CDN: Static assets and images
• Database: Query result caching for expensive aggregations

---

## 7. Authentication & Authorization

**Decision**: JWT-based authentication with role-based access control (RBAC)

**Rationale**:
• **Stateless**: Scales horizontally without session storage
• **Performance**: No database lookup for each request
• **Flexibility**: Easy to add claims and permissions
• **Integration**: Works well with third-party services

**Trade-offs**:
• (+) Scalable and performant
• (+) Works across different clients
• (-) Token revocation complexity
• (-) Token size can grow with claims

---

## 8. API Versioning Strategy

**Decision**: URL path versioning (/v1, /v2) with backward compatibility commitment

**Rationale**:
• **Clarity**: Version is explicit in the URL
• **Client control**: Clients choose when to upgrade
• **Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI per version
• **Deprecation**: Clear deprecation timeline (6 months)

**Trade-offs**:
• (+) Simple to implement and understand
• (+) Easy to route and load balance
• (-) URL changes require client updates
• (-) Potential code duplication across versions

---

## 9. State Management (Frontend)

**Decision**: React Query for server state, Context API for UI state, Local storage for preferences

**Rationale**:
• **Separation of concerns**: Clear distinction between server and UI state
• **Performance**: React Query handles caching, deduplication, and background refetching
• **Simplicity**: Avoid Redux boilerplate for small team
• **Persistence**: User preferences survive sessions

**Trade-offs**:
• (+) Minimal boilerplate
• (+) Built-in optimizations
• (-) Learning curve for React Query
• (-) Potential prop drilling without global state

---

## 10. Testing Strategy

**Decision**: Testing pyramid with emphasis on integration tests

**Rationale**:
• **ROI**: Integration tests catch most bugs with reasonable effort
• **Confidence**: End-to-end tests for critical user journeys
• **Speed**: Unit tests for business logic and utilities
• **Maintenance**: Fewer, more stable tests

**Distribution**:
• Unit tests: 40% (utilities, helpers, pure functions)
• Integration tests: 50% (API endpoints, service layer)
• E2E tests: 10% (critical user paths)

---

## 11. Error Handling & Monitoring

**Decision**: Structured logging with correlation IDs and centralized error tracking

**Rationale**:
• **Debugging**: Trace requests across the entire stack
• **Alerting**: Proactive issue detection
• **Compliance**: Audit trail for financial operations
• **Performance**: Identify bottlenecks and slow queries

**Implementation**:
• Correlation ID in headers
• Structured JSON logging
• Error boundaries in React
• Sentry for error tracking
• Custom metrics for business KPIs

---

## 12. Build & Deployment Pipeline

**Decision**: Docker containers with GitHub Actions CI/CD

**Rationale**:
• **Consistency**: Same environment from dev to production
• **Portability**: Deploy anywhere that runs containers
• **Automation**: Reduce human error in deployments
• **Rollback**: Easy version management with container tags

**Trade-offs**:
• (+) Platform agnostic
• (+) Easy local development
• (-) Container overhead
• (-) Additional complexity layer
